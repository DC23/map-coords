# Map Coordinates

Add coordinates to any square or hex map. Use the Measurement Controls menu with the Map icon to toggle between modes.

Set the numbering style, and offset in the module settings.

Alt-Click to "ping" your mouse location with its coordinates. (keybind changeable in module settings)

## Known Issues

- Alt-Click to ping mouse location is currently disabled due to changes in the Foundry API. I plan to fix this, but it's a lower priority than getting the coordinates overlay working.
