> [!IMPORTANT]
> With the v0.4.0 release, the missing features have been reinstated. There is still work to do to refine what's here, but this module is feature complete once more!

- Add coordinates to any square or hex map. Use the Measurement Controls menu with the World icon 🌐 to toggle between display modes.
- Set the numbering style, and offset in the module settings.
- Alt-Click to "ping" your mouse location with its coordinates. The keybind is changeable in the module settings.

The main improvements planned are quality of life enhancements, like having scenes remember the display setting mode instead of resetting each time you change scenes, and the ability to change the text colour. There are probably also bugs :)

Use the Measurement Controls menu with the World Map icon 🌐 to toggle between display modes.
