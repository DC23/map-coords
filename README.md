> [!IMPORTANT]
> I, DC23, have just taken over maintenance of this module and am currently focused on bringing it up to date
> with the Foundry v12 API. In order to release a minimal working version as quickly as possible, I'm temporarily
> disabling the following features:
>
> - Alt-Click to ping mouse location
> - Coordinate display on hex grids
>
> Both have issues that I plan to fix in the next release. I'd rather leave them out for now than release
> when I know they don't work correctly, or delay when I'm not sure when I'll have time to fix them.
> Since I do have a Foundry v12 version with square grids working now, I'll release that first then catch up
> with the other features.

Add coordinates to any square or hex map. Use the Measurement Controls menu with the World icon 🌐 to toggle between modes.

Set the numbering style, and offset in the module settings.

Alt-Click to "ping" your mouse location with its coordinates (keybind changeable in module settings).
